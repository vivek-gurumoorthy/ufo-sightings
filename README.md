## Overview of Analysis
The webpage resulting from this analysis aims to describe all the UFO sightings that meet certain user-entered criteria. This can give the user a information about the prevalence and history of these supernatural phenomena.

## Results
A search on the webpage and a change in the information displayed in the table is performed by entering desired search terms in each of the search bars as necessary. For example, if a user were to look for the UFO sightings in which the city was "benton", the user would enter "benton" in the "Enter a City" parameter and press Enter. The resulting table would only include the UFO sightings that meet this specific criteria. 

The table before entering search criteria:

The table after entering search criteria:

This searching also works when multiple criteria are entered, such as looking for all sightings that occur in the United States and consist of a circular UFO:

## Summary
One drawback of the webpage and associated displayed data is that not much data exists for countries besides the United States and Canada. 

Opportunities for the further development of this wepbage could be:
1. Trying to add table summary statistics that are generated after each iteration of filtering.
2. Trying to find additional data available on the web for alternate explanations for these supernatural phenomena from police reports and/or news articles.
